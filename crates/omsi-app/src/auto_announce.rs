//! The automatic stop announcements: at each stop of a depot file that keeps two recordings
//! per stop, the game presses the IBIS's "next stop" key once, as the driver does. That is
//! what plays the "… arrived" recording: a stock IBIS steps its stop counter on by itself
//! only when a stop is left, so without the press only the "next stop is …" half of each
//! stop is ever heard. The game plays nothing itself - the key runs the vehicle's own script,
//! with its volume, its 3D sound and its terminus suffix.
//!
//! What the scripts do is left alone: a press is skipped where the counter already stands
//! where it should, an arrival is pressed for again until it is heard (electrics off, another
//! IBIS mode, a script that was busy), and a departure the scripts did not step on by
//! themselves is made up for once after a grace period. That last is the watchdog for the
//! maps whose depot files the scripts cannot follow, and it is armed only where there is a
//! second recording to miss.
//!
//! Standing at the trip's first stop, the game presses the key once, as a driver does before
//! pulling out (see [`AutoAnnounce::park`]): that plays the line's own start recording -
//! `welcome…` on the southern maps, `1041` on Beijing's - and leaves the counter on the entry
//! before the first "next stop is …" one, so that the scripts' own step on leaving plays the
//! first stop's recording. A start recording the scripts start late is not waited for: the
//! departure recording takes over, as it would in service.
